# music-classifiacation
For this specific project, the task was to categorize songs by music genre using machine learning techniques. Music genre classification is a well-known challenge in the scientific field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), since it has many applications in recommendation systems and music search, organization and recognition platforms. In this study, there was used a publicly available dataset in order to extract features, train our algorithm and finally test it, in order to observe its accuracy capabilities. There were used Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) among other features. Achieved an accuracy of 72% for 10 classes of the dataset.
